## Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering the fundamentals of Python programming.

## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside
This repo covers the core building blocks of Python, broken down into easy-to-understand topics with practical examples.

# 01 - Python Introduction

This section introduces the core concepts that help in understanding Python and programming in general.

## ðŸ”¹ What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a **step-by-step set of instructions** to solve a specific problem.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
To make tea:
1. Boil water
2. Add tea leaves
3. Add sugar and milk
4. Let it brew
5. Pour and serve

In coding, algorithms tell the computer **what to do, in what order**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is writing the steps of an algorithm in **simple, human-like language**, without actual code.

ðŸ’¡ Example (to find the sum of 2 numbers):
Start 
Set a = 5 
Set b = 3 
Add a and b â†’ result 
Print result 
End

Pseudocode helps you plan the logic **before** writing real code.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a tool where you can:
- Write and run Python code
- Add notes and explanations
- Show output below each code block

Itâ€™s great for:
- Learning
- Data analysis
- Step-by-step coding

ðŸ’» Example use: Write code to calculate VAT and show results with notes.

## ðŸ”¹ What is an IDE?

IDE = **Integrated Development Environment**  
Itâ€™s a software where you write, run, and debug code â€” like Microsoft Word, but for programming.

Examples:
- VS Code (light, modern)
- PyCharm (powerful)
- Jupyter (interactive, browser-based)
